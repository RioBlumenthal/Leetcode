# LeetCode Problem 121: Best Time to Buy and Sell Stock

## Problem Description
You are given an array prices where prices[i] is the price of a given stock on the ith day.

You want to maximize your profit by choosing a single day to buy one stock and choosing a different day in the future to sell that stock.

Return the maximum profit you can achieve from this transaction. If you cannot achieve any profit, return 0.

## Solution Approach
My first thought was just an easy double for loop, but then I realized that we could just keep track of the cheapest so far (the current best time to buy/have bought) and the max profit to be made.

## Complexity Analysis
Time complexity is O(N)
